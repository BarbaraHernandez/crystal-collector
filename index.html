        <div class = "scroll">
            <h2>Hello adventurer!</h2>
            <p>To escape the Crystal Cave you must pay a toll to the Crystal Guardian. Though we call it a toll, you might think of it as more of a bribe. It's not an official law, but it is the payment he requires. So, he will decide randomly on a crystal currency value each time you attempt to leave.</p>
            <p>There are four types of crystal below. By clicking on a crystal, you will gain a specific amount of crystal currency. </p>
            <p>If your crystal currency matches the toll, you win. However, if the your crystal currency exceeds the toll then you will lose.</p>
            <p>The Crystal Guardian will be insulted by your sloppiness and strike you over the head, causing you to drop all of your crystals. At which point, you have to try all over again.</p>
            <p class = "whisper">I know it doesn't seem fair, but no one said the Crystal Cave was fair.</p>
            <p>The value of each type of crystal will be hidden until you collect it(click).</p>
            <p>Alas! The Crystal Guardian is also fickle, and the value of each crystal is also set by him. So, the value of each crystal will ALSO change with each attempt to pay the toll.</p>
