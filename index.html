            <h2>Hello Adventurer!</h2>
            <p>To escape the Crystal Cave you must pay a toll to the Crystal Guardian. Though we call it a toll, you might think of it as more of a bribe. It's not an official law, but it is the payment he requires.</p> 
            <p>Each time you attempt to leave, the Crystal Guardian will set a random toll.</p>
            <p>There are four types of crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will gain a specific amount of crystal currency. </p>
            <p>The value of each type of crystal will be hidden, but watch your crystal currency carefully as you collect it(click) and you should be able to deduce the values.</p>
            <p>If your crystal currency matches the toll, you win! You may leave the cave. However, it must match exactly.</p> 
            <p>If your crystal currency exceeds the toll then you will lose.</p>
            <p>The Crystal Guardian will be insulted by your sloppiness and force you to drop all of your crystals. You will have to try all over again.</p>
            <p class = "whisper">Crystal Guardains are quite rigid.</p>
            <p>Alas! The Crystal Guardian is petty as well as corrupt, and he decides the value of the crystals. So, if you fail to pay the toll exactly, he will randomly change the values as well as the toll on your next attempt.</p>
            <p>TL;DR - Click the crystals until your number matches the toll, but don't go over!
            <h3>Good Luck!</h3>
