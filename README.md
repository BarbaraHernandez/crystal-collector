Week 4 JQuery Homework

About My Game:
    I decided to go with a fantasy theme. In the game the player is an unlucky adventurer who has become trapped in the Crystal Cave. The exit is blocked by the Crystal Guardian, who demands "toll" of his own choosing before the player may exit and win the game. As you might expect from crystals, the Crystal Guardian is unyielding and multifaceted, which makes him seem allthemore capricious. He will only accept an exact toll, but also expects the play to intrinsically understand the value of the crystals they are collecting.

    In game play terms, there is a randomly set target number (the toll) and the player must match it exactly. The player can do this by repeatedly clicking crystals, which each have a randomly assigned value. By carefully monitoring the changes to their running total, the player can deduce each crystal's value and hopefully meet the toll exactly without going over.

About My Code:

    The important variables in this code are: the toll, the individual crystal values, and the user's running total. 
    It is important define the function which assigns random value to the toll and crystals. It is also important to user math functions to ensure it is possible to make the user's running total equal the toll. I have multiplied the numbers by ten to make this simpler for the player.
    The next order of business is to define win and loss conditions.
    Once win or loss conditions are met, we must record the result and reset the game.
    On game reset it is important that all of the values reset so that the randomized variables change value and the running total is reset to 0.
